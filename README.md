AO_MM: This implementation provides an AO-MM algorithm that jointly optimizes the IRS phase-shift matrix and the beamforming vector to minimize secrecy outage probability (SOP) in IRS-assisted systems. The phase-shift design subproblem is tackled using a Majorization-Minimization (MM) approach with a closed-form update per iteration, while the beamforming vector is updated using a generalized Rayleigh quotient method.
